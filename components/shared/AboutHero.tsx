					My story

					<p>
						Hi ðŸ‘‹ I&apos;m Abhijit aka Proxy (internet nickname), I code
						sometimes ideally.
					</p>
					<p>
						I began my journey not too long ago. I was introduced to the world
						of coding by an ad by &quot;Chintu&quot;. I became curious because I
						was always passionate about computers and technology. I started
						watching YouTube videos on making games in JavaScript and created a
						few games like Pong and T-Rex Runner. At the time, I was just doing
						it for fun and wasn&apos;t very serious about coding, so I
						eventually stopped.
					</p>
					<p>
						In 2022, I was reintroduced to coding when I saw people freelancing
						and making money from it. In November, I earned my first 1800 INR by
						creating a Discord bot with Python. This motivated me to learn more,
						so I picked up web development, and then moved on to working with
						various technologies, libraries, and frameworks. I learned about
						backend operations, databases, scalability, and real-time
						communications.

					Tech i use

				<div className="flex flex-col gap-3 tracking-tight">
					<p>
						As a full-stack developer, I start by designing the user interface
						with Figma, which is great to make attractive designs. then, I plan
						and draw the design of the flow for handling backend operations,
						mainly using Nodejs as for now its the best for me.
					</p>
					<p>
						For backend functionality, I use Hono.js when I need performance and
						scalability. Express for more common projects. On the front end, I
						use React and Nextjs, along with Tailwind CSS and various component
						libraries, to build responsive and engaging user interfaces.
					</p>
					<p>
						For databases, I&apos;ve mostly used MongoDB and Prisma, but
						I&apos;m currently switching to Convex for better performance and
						scalability. I also use TypeScript for better code management,
						GraphQL for efficient data handling, and Docker for easy deployment.
						Additionally, I&apos;m learning various skills such as Java, Python,
						Rust, DevOps to further enhance my skills and streamline the
						development process. This mix of tools helps me create a better
						version of myself.
